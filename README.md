# Cloud Bucket Service

Cloud Bucket Service is a scalable and secure backend solution for managing file storage in the cloud. It provides a RESTful API for uploading, downloading, listing, and deleting files in cloud storage buckets such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. The service abstracts the complexities of interacting with different cloud providers, offering a unified interface for developers.

## Features

- **Unified API:** Interact with multiple cloud storage providers using a consistent API.
- **File Operations:** Upload, download, list, and delete files and folders.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure endpoints with API keys or OAuth.
- **Multi-bucket Support:** Manage multiple buckets across providers.
- **Metadata Management:** Store and retrieve custom metadata for files.
- **Event Hooks:** Trigger webhooks or serverless functions on file events.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Track usage and monitor performance.
- **Extensible:** Easily add support for new cloud providers.

## Use Cases

- Centralized file storage for web and mobile applications.
- Backup and archival solutions.
- Media asset management.
- Data ingestion pipelines.
